Introduction
=====

Luz Framework is a straightforward web application framework based on MEAN (Mongo, Express, Angular and Node.js)

This framework has been created in order to set up a development base for a few software migrations I have in store for some customers.

Features (*so far...*)
=====
- File-system based routing
  - Current page variable through Angular
- User authentication (using *Passport*)
  - Permissions (*still incomplete!*
- Menu items
- Model context
